  <h1>about</h1>
  <p>
  <p><span class="emphasis">Jenna Perry</span> is trained as a human behavioral data scientist with a <span class="emphasis">strong background in both computer science and human subjects research techniques</span>. At present she is the primary data scientist for <a href="https://www.marketamerica.com/" target="_blank">Market America</a>, a large e-commerce company, where she focuses on human behavioral analytics and search optimization / UX. She has previously worked as a freelance statistical consultant, and as a programmer in the Research Triangle Park at <a href="https://www.nuventra.com/" target="_blank">Nuventra Pharma Sciences</a>, where her work involved organizing and visualizing pharmaceutical data and preparing it for FDA submission. She also worked as a post-baccalaureate research associate / lab manager in Dr. Elizabeth Losin's <a href="http://www.losinlab.org/" target="_blank">Social and Cultural Neuroscience Lab</a> at the University of Miami, an undergraduate research fellow at Dr. Luke Chang's <a href="http://cosanlab.com/" target="_blank">Computational Social Affective Neuroscience Lab</a> at Dartmouth College, and an undergraduate honors thesis student at Dr. Kristen Lindquist's <a href="https://www.carolinaaffectivescience.com/" target="_blank">Carolina Affective Science Lab</a> at the University of North Carolina.
  
  <p>Armed with excellent research training and <span class="emphasis">five years of full-time professional experience manipulating and analyzing data</span> with a focus on human behavior, Jenna brings to the table proven skills in research design and data analytics. With formal training in computer science, deep practical experience in several programming languages, and the self-motivation to expand that foundation to include familiarity with the programming language best suited to the project at hand, she's willing to work as a team-player and help get the job done. Currently, she <span class="emphasis">works primarily with R and SQL</span> and at times JavaScript, but has previously used Python and C#, in addition to dabbling in Java, C, and so on. Specific areas of laboratory-based research expertise include psychophysiology (measuring heart rate and skin conductance as proxy measures of nervous system activity), the study of stress and pain, and questionnaire development, administration, and scoring. She has strong scientific writing and communication skills and experience managing large datasets containing sensitive personal information. Another skillset is a working knowledge of Adobe Creative Suite products like Photoshop, Dreamweaver, and Premiere.</p>
  <p>When she's not troubleshooting code, working with human subjects, or running analyses, Jenna enjoys <i>Star Wars</i>, video gaming, and her two <a href="images/molly.jpg" target="_blank">adorable</a> <a href="images/oliver.jpg" target="_blank">cats</a>.</p>

  <h1>skillset</h1>
  <p>Here's a handful of things Jenna's good at:</p>
  <ul>
	  <li><i>R,</i> especially for data analysis, machine learning, dimensionality reduction, and reshaping, as well as some specialty packages (ggplot2, tidyverse, caret, emmeans, magick, scales, effects, etc.)</li>
	  <li><i>statistical analyses</i> at an advanced level: mixed effect modeling, hierarchical and linear regressions, ANOVAs, time series-based analyses, principal component analysis, logistic regressions, and so on</li>
	  <li><i>data management</i>, especially for large datasets that contain confidential personal identifying information and require stringent access rules
	  <li><i>study design</i> for quantitative data streams, especially user-facing A/B testing</li>
	  <li><i>psychophysiology</i> collection, processing, and analysis</li>
	  <li><i>human subjects administration</i> including ethics considerations, data safety, forward-facing communication, etc.</li>
	  <li><i>teaching,</i> including undergraduate mentorship, intern management, and several years of tutoring and statistical consultations</li>
	  <li><i>results communication,</i> via presentations, truly readable summaries, visualizations, etc. suitable for viewers of all levels of familiarity with source material</li>
  </ul>
