  <h1>about</h1>
  <p>
  <p><span class="emphasis">Jenna Perry</span> is trained as a computational/social neuroscientist with a strong <span class="emphasis">background in both data science and human subjects research techniques</span>. She is currently working as a programmer in Research Triangle Park at <a href="https://www.nuventra.com/" target="_blank">Nuventra Pharma Sciences</a>, where her work involves organizing and visualizing pharmaceutical data and preparing it for FDA submission. Previously, she worked as a post-baccalaureate research associate / lab manager in Dr. Elizabeth Losin's <a href="http://www.losinlab.org/" target="_blank">Social and Cultural Neuroscience Lab</a>. Previously she completed a Bachelor of Science degree in Psychology, with minors in Computer Science and Neuroscience, as a thesis student in Dr. Kristen Lindquist's <a href="https://www.carolinaaffectivescience.com/" target="_blank">Carolina Affective Science Lab</a> at the University of North Carolina. She also worked as a summer student in Dr. Luke Chang's <a href="http://cosanlab.com/" target="_blank">Computational Social Affective Neuroscience Lab</a> at Dartmouth College.</p>
  <p>Armed with excellent research training and nearly <span class="emphasis">four years of full-time professional experience manipulating and analyzing data</span>, Jenna brings to the table proven skills in research design and data analytics. With formal training in computer science, a firm base of practical coding experience, and the self-motivation to expand that foundation to include familiarity with the programming language best suited to the project at hand, she's willing to work as a team-player and help get the job done. Currently, she <span class="emphasis">works primarily with R</span> and at times JavaScript, but has previously used Python and Java, in addition to dabbling in MySQL, C, and so on. Specific areas of research expertise include psychophysiology (measuring heart rate and skin conductance as proxy measures of nervous system activity), the study of stress and pain, and questionnaire development, administration, and scoring. She has strong scientific writing and communication skills and experience managing large datasets containing sensitive personal information. Another skillset is a working knowledge of Adobe Creative Suite products like Photoshop, Dreamweaver, and Premiere.</p>
  <p>When she's not troubleshooting code, working with human subjects, or running analyses, Jenna enjoys <i>Star Wars</i>, video gaming, and her two <a href="images/molly.jpg" target="_blank">adorable</a> <a href="images/oliver.jpg" target="_blank">cats</a>.</p>

  <h1>skillset</h1>
  <p>Here's a handful of things Jenna's good at:</p>
  <ul>
	  <li><i>R,</i> especially for data analysis, reduction, and reshaping, as well as some specialty packages (ggplot2, imager, magick, scales, effects, etc.)</li>
	  <li><i>statistical analyses</i> at an intermediate-advanced level: mixed effect modeling, heirarchical and linear regressions, ANOVAs, time series-based analyses, and so on</li>
	  <li><i>data management</i>, especially for large datasets that contain confidential personal identifying information and require stringent access rules
	  <li><i>study design</i> for quantitative data streams</li>
	  <li><i>psychophysiology</i> collection, processing, and analysis</li>
	  <li><i>human subjects administration</i> (ethics considerations, data safety, forward-facing communication, etc.)</li>
	  <li><i>teaching,</i> including undergraduate mentorship and several years of tutoring and statistical consultations</li>
	  <li><i>results communication,</i> via presentations, truly readable summaries, visualizations, etc. suitable for viewers of all levels of familiarity with source material</li>
  </ul>

<div id="example_web" class="container-fluid content-section">
  <h1>web design examples</h1>
  <p>While not necessarily a front end developer by trade, Jenna of course has a working knowledge of <span class="emphasis">HTML and CSS (especially Bootstrap)</span>, and a more refined skill with <span class="emphasis">JavaScript (including jQuery)</span>. Here's a website she wrote and manages:</p>
  <ul>
		<li><a href="https://www.sollanempire.com/" target="_blank">website of Christopher Ruocchio, science fiction novelist</a></li>
  </ul>

<div id="example_D3JS" class="container-fluid content-section">
  <h1>D3.JS examples</h1>
  <p>Jenna taught herself D3.JS during her summer at Dartmouth, focusing on dynamic generation and manipulation of visual content for the creation of a <span class="emphasis">customizable rating wheel</span> aimed at scientific research:</p>
