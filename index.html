  <h1>about</h1>
  <p>
  <p><span class="emphasis">Jenna Perry</span> is a computational neuroscientist with a strong <span class="emphasis">background in both data science and human subjects research techniques</span>. She is currently seeking a position in Research Triangle Park where she can put these skills to good use, with a team that loves coding as much as she does. Though originally from North Carolina, at present Jenna is living in Miami and working in Dr. Elizabeth Losin's <a href="http://www.losinlab.org/" target="_blank">Social and Cultural Neuroscience Lab</a>. Previously she completed a Bachelor of Science degree in Psychology, with minors in Computer Science and Neuroscience, as a thesis student in Dr. Kristen Lindquist's <a href="https://www.carolinaaffectivescience.com/" target="_blank">Carolina Affective Science Lab</a> at the University of North Carolina. She also worked as a summer student in Dr. Luke Chang's <a href="http://cosanlab.com/" target="_blank">Computational Social Affective Neuroscience Lab</a> at Dartmouth College.</p>
  <p>Armed with excellent research training and <span class="emphasis">two years of full-time professional experience manipulating and analyzing data</span>, Jenna brings to the table proven skills in research design and data analytics. With formal training in computer science, a firm base of practical coding experience, and the self-motivation to expand that foundation to include familiarity with the programming language best suited to the project at hand, she's willing to work as a team-player and help get the job done. Currently, she <span class="emphasis">works primarily with R</span> and at times JavaScript, but has previously used Python and Java, in addition to dabbling in MySQL, C, and so on. Specific areas of research expertise include psychophysiology (measuring heart rate and skin conductance as proxy measures of nervous system activity), the study of stress and pain, and questionnaire development, administration, and scoring. She has strong scientific writing and communication skills and a working knowledge of Adobe Creative Suite products like Photoshop, Dreamweaver, and Premiere.</p>
  <p>When she's not troubleshooting code, working with human subjects, or running analyses, Jenna enjoys <i>Star Wars</i>, video gaming, and her two <a href="images/molly.jpg" target="_blank">adorable</a> <a href="images/oliver.jpg" target="_blank">cats</a>.</p>

<div id="skills" class="container-fluid content-section">
  <h1>skillset</h1>
  <p>Here's a handful of things Jenna's good at:</p>
  <ul>
	  <li><i>R,</i> especially for data analysis, reduction, and reshaping, as well as some specialty packages (ggplot2, imager, magick, scales, effects, etc.)</li>
	  <li><i>statistical analyses</i> at an intermediate-advanced level: mixed effect modeling, heirarchical and linear regressions, ANOVAs, time series-based analyses, and so on</li>
	  <li><i>study design</i> for quantitative data streams</li>
	  <li><i>psychophysiology</i> collection, processing, and analysis</li>
	  <li><i>human subjects administration</i> (ethics considerations, data safety, forward-facing communication, etc.)</li>
	  <li><i>teaching,</i> including undergraduate mentorship and several years of tutoring and statistical consultations</li>
	  <li><i>results communication,</i> via presentations, truly readable summaries, visualizations, etc. suitable for viewers of all levels of familiarity with source material</li>
  </ul>

<div id="example_R" class="container-fluid content-section">
  <h1>R examples</h1>
  <p>R is the <span class="emphasis">language Jenna knows best</span>. Check out some of these coding examples:</p>

</div>
<div id="example_web" class="container-fluid content-section">
  <h1>web design examples</h1>
  <p>While not necessarily a front end developer by trade, Jenna of course has a working knowledge of <span class="emphasis">HTML and CSS (especially Bootstrap)</span>, and a more refined skill with <span class="emphasis">JavaScript (including jQuery)</span>. Here's a website she wrote and manages:</p>
  <ul>
		<li><a href="https://www.sollanempire.com/" target="_blank">website of Christopher Ruocchio, science fiction novelist</a></li>
  </ul>

<div id="example_D3JS" class="container-fluid content-section">
  <h1>D3.JS examples</h1>
  <p>Jenna taught herself D3.JS during her summer at Dartmouth, focusing on dynamic generation and manipulation of visual content for the creation of a <span class="emphasis">customizable rating wheel</span> aimed at scientific research:</p>
  <ul>

<div id="example_stats" class="container-fluid content-section">
  <h1>statistical analysis examples</h1>
  <p>In addition to undergraduate and graduate level courses in statistics, Jenna has accrued a great deal of <span class="emphasis">practical experience working with data</span>. Below, look over the results of her undergraduate honors thesis (or read the full version here). More recent examples of her work with stats are available upon request.</p>
